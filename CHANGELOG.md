0.11.0 (2018-09-25)
-------------------
* **Breaking**: The default sampler now launches background tasks to poll sampling rules from X-Ray service. See more details on how to create sampling rules: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-sampling.html.
* **Breaking**: The sampling modules related to local sampling rules have been renamed and moved to `sampling/local` namespace.
* **Breaking**: The default json serializer is switched to `multi_json` for experimental JRuby support. Now you need to specify `oj` or `jrjackson` in Gemfile. [PR#5](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-ruby/pull/5)
* **Breaking**: The SDK now requires `aws-sdk-xray` >= `1.4.0`.
* Feature: Environment variable `AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS` now takes an additional notation in `tcp:127.0.0.1:2000 udp:127.0.0.2:2001` to set TCP and UDP destination separately. By default it assumes a X-Ray daemon listening to both UDP and TCP traffic on `127.0.0.1:2000`. 
* Bugfix - Call only once if `current_entity` is nil. [PR#9](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-ruby/pull/9)
