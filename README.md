### :mega: OpenTelemetry Ruby with AWS X-Ray

AWS X-Ray recommends using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) to instrument your application **instead of this X-Ray SDK** due to its wider range of features and instrumentations. See the [AWS X-Ray docs on Working with Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-ruby.html) for more help with choosing between ADOT and X-Ray SDK.

If you want additional features when tracing your Ruby applications, please [open an issue on the OpenTelemetry Ruby Instrumentation repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby-contrib/issues/new?labels=enhancement&title=X-Ray%20Compatible%20Feature%20Request).

# AWS X-Ray SDK for Ruby (beta)

## Installing

The AWS X-Ray SDK for Ruby is compatible with Ruby 2.3.6 and newer Ruby versions. It has experimental support for JRuby 9.2.0.0 (still forthcoming).

To install the Ruby gem for your project, add it to your project Gemfile. You must also add either the [Oj](https://github.com/ohler55/oj) or [JrJackson](https://github.com/guyboertje/jrjackson) gems, for MRI and JRuby respectively, for JSON parsing. The default JSON parser will not work properly, currently.

```
# Gemfile
gem 'aws-xray-sdk'
gem 'oj', platform: :mri
gem 'jrjackson', platform: :jruby
```

Then run `bundle install`.

## Documentation

The [developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide) provides in-depth guidance about using the AWS X-Ray service.
The [API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-ruby/latest/reference/) provides documentation for public APIs of all classes in the SDK.

## Quick Start

**Configuration**

```ruby
require 'aws-xray-sdk'

# For configuring sampling rules through X-Ray service
# please see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-sampling.html.
# The doc below defines local fallback sampling rules which has lower priority.
my_sampling_rules = {
  version: 2,
  rules: [
    {
      description: 'healthcheck',
      host: '*',
      http_method: 'GET',
      url_path: '/ping',
      fixed_target: 0,
      rate: 0
    }
  ],
  default: {
    fixed_target: 1,
    rate: 0.2
  }
}

user_config = {
  sampling: true,
  sampling_rules: my_sampling_rules,
  name: 'default_segment_name',
  daemon_address: '127.0.0.1:3000',
  context_missing: 'LOG_ERROR',
  patch: %I[net_http aws_sdk]
}

XRay.recorder.configure(user_config)
```

**Working with Lambda**

```ruby
# Bundle aws-xray-sdk with your code.
# Require any aws-sdks and http libraries to be used, then...
require 'aws-xray-sdk/lambda'
# aws-sdk and http calls from here on will be instrumented
```

See also [lib/aws-xray-sdk/lambda.rb](lib/aws-xray-sdk/lambda.rb)

**Working with Rails**

```ruby
# Edit Gemfile to add XRay middleware
gem 'aws-xray-sdk', require: ['aws-xray-sdk/facets/rails/railtie']

# Configure the recorder in app_root/config/initializers/aws_xray.rb
Rails.application.config.xray = {
  # default segment name generated by XRay middleware
  name: 'myrails',
  patch: %I[net_http aws_sdk],
  # record db transactions as subsegments
  active_record: true
}
```

**Adding metadata/annotations using recorder**

```ruby
require 'aws-xray-sdk'

# Add annotations to the current active entity
XRay.recorder.annotations[:k1] = 'v1'
XRay.recorder.annotations.update k2: 'v2', k3: 3

# Add metadata to the current active entity
XRay.recorder.metadata[:k1] = 'v1' # add to default namespace
XRay.recorder.metadata(namespace: :my_ns).update k2: 'v2'

XRay.recorder.sampled? do
  XRay.recorder.metadata.update my_meta # expensive metadata generation here
end
```

**Capture**

```ruby
require 'aws-xray-sdk'

XRay.recorder.capture('name_for_subsegment') do |subsegment|
  resp = myfunc()
  subsegment.annotations.update k1: 'v1'
  resp
end

# Manually apply the parent segment for the captured subsegment
XRay.recorder.capture('name_for_subsegment', segment: my_segment) do |subsegment|
  myfunc()
end
```

**Thread Injection**

```ruby
require 'aws-xray-sdk'

XRay.recorder.configure({patch: %I[net_http]})

uri = URI.parse('http://aws.amazon.com/')
# Get the active entity from current call context
entity = XRay.recorder.current_entity

workers = (0...3).map do
  Thread.new do
    begin
      # set X-Ray context for this thread
      XRay.recorder.inject_context entity do
        http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
        http.request(Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri))
      end
    rescue ThreadError
    end
  end
end

workers.map(&:join)
```

**Start a custom segment/subsegment**

```ruby
require 'aws-xray-sdk'

# Start a segment
segment = XRay.recorder.begin_segment 'my_service'
# Start a subsegment
subsegment = XRay.recorder.begin_subsegment 'outbound_call', namespace: 'remote'

# Add metadata or annotation here if necessary
my_annotations = {
  k1: 'v1',
  k2: 1024
}
segment.annotations.update my_annotations

# Add metadata to default namespace
subsegment.metadata[:k1] = 'v1'

# Set user for the segment (subsegment is not supported)
segment.user = 'my_name'

# End segment/subsegment
XRay.recorder.end_subsegment
XRay.recorder.end_segment
```
